Step 1: Create repository
   
Step 2: Change setting to GitHub actions
  
Step 3: Add the files to the repository
Python Code (application.py):
Python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    message = "Hello from your Python web application!"
    return render_template("index.html", message=message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

index.html:
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Python Web Application</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
</body>
</html>

ci-cd.yml:
YAML
name: CI/CD with Static Code Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install flake8

      - name: Run static code analysis
        run: flake8

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [ lint ]  # Only run this job after 'lint' succeeds
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python environment
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'  # Adjust if needed

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming requirements.txt exists

      - name: Build the application
        run: python setup.py install  # Adjust if you have a different build process

  deploy:  # Add this job for deployment (specific steps will depend on your deployment target)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [ build ]  # Only run this job after 'build' succeeds
    steps:  
 


Step 4: Go to actions and use the suitable action for deployment
  
Step 5: Deployment procedure starts with workflow execution 
  
Step 6: All the workflow configurations have to be passed
  
Step 7: Successfully Deployed and ready to use 
  
Explanation:
1.	Python Code: The application.py file defines a simple Flask web application that serves an index page with a welcome message. The index.html file provides the basic structure for the HTML page.
2.	GitHub Actions Workflow: The ci-cd.yml file defines a workflow named "CI/CD with Static Code Analysis".
o	Trigger: It runs on push events to the main branch.
o	Jobs:
	lint: Runs code style checks with flake8 before proceeding.
	build: Installs dependencies, sets up the Python environment, and builds the application using python setup.py install (assuming a setup.py file exists). This job only runs if the lint job succeeds (needs: [ lint ]).
	deploy (placeholder): Add this job with specific steps to deploy your application to your chosen target (e.g., AWS, Heroku). This job only runs after the build job succeeds (needs: [ build ]).
Features:
•	Clear explanations: Comments are included to explain each step in the workflow.
•	Action configuration: Basic action configurations are provided for actions/checkout, actions/setup-python, and flake8.
•	Flexibility: The build step uses python setup.py install, but you can adjust it if you have a different build process.
•	Deployment placeholder: A placeholder deploy job is included, requiring you to add specific steps for your deployment target.
•	Error handling: Consider adding error handling (e.g., using if statements) to gracefully handle potential failures during lint, build, or deployment stages.
